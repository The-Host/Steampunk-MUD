Steampunk-MUD
=============

This is a project that is being made by a group of people that have 
been brought together because of curiosity and hunger to learn more 
about programming. We wanted a project that would include a lot of 
concepts, like OOP, functional programming, GUI, networking, et al, 
so we decided that a game could include all that.

The language we chose was Python. And there are a lot of reasons 
behind it, some of them being:

 * Itâ€™s very easy to use
 * Clean syntax
 * It makes us take into consideration good programming practices
 * It has libraries for everything we need
 * Great packaging system

Our goal with this project is basically to enhance our programming 
skills in general (algorithms, logic, math) to prepare us better if 
we want to work with these things.
