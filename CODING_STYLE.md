Code Style
----------
All code submitted or committed to the project needs to follow
the guidelines outlined in Python PEP 8, which may be found at:

    http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

##A quick list of code style points

 * 4-space indendation, NO TABS!
 * Unix line endings.
 * CamelCase is only used for classes, nothing else.
 * All non-global variable names and all function names are to be
   lowercase, words separated by underscores. Variable names should
   always be more than two letters long.
 * Module-level global variables (only) are to be in CAPITAL letters.

##Documentation
Modules, functions, classes and class methods should all start with 
at least one line of docstring summing up the function's purpose. 
Ideally also explain eventual arguments and caveats. Add comments 
where appropriate.
